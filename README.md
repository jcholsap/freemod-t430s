Creating for everyone a personal computing device that is securable, usable, and modifiable.

Securable:
With the work already out there, we should be able to get a secure, reliable firmware for this laptop in a short period of time. We're just cutting and pasting and making and verifying.

Usable:
Several aspects of this device are attractive. It's under 4 pounds (1.8 Kg), the 3rd generation CPUs are still capable processors today, the PC3 RAM speeds & latencies are still good performers, and the SATA III, Thunderbolt, and USB 3.0 interfaces are also still very good performers.

Modifiable:
Key upgrade possiblities include: 2K LCD screen, 7-row Keyboard, overclocking, and i7 Quad-core. Granted the i7 upgrade requires BGA rework. But these mods are becoming more practical and more affordable all the time.
